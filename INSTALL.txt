How to install and start IP Right
=================================

Copy IpRight.exe to a sensible location, let's say
"C:\Program Files (x86)\IP Right\IpRight.exe" on 64 bit Windows or
"C:\Program Files\IP Right\IpRight.exe" on 32 bit Windows.

Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

On 64 bit Windows, type:

C:\Program Files (x86)\IP Right\IpRight.exe /INSTALL [ENTER]

On 32 bit Windows, type:

C:\Program Files\IP Right\IpRight.exe /INSTALL [ENTER]

The service will install and be set to start when Windows starts.

To start the service immediately, type:

net start "IP Right" [ENTER]

To stop the service, type:

net stop "IP Right" [ENTER]

How to configure IP Right
=========================

Once installed and started, open a web browser and navigate to
http://[IP address or host name of IP Right service]:54321.

Examples: http://localhost:54321
					http://192.168.0.1:54321
					http://mydnsparkupdateclientpc:54321

Tick the "Check" section, set "Seconds" to at least 600 (DNS Park rule) tick
"Internet", put ipdetect.dnspark.com in "Server", use 80 or 8888 in "Port" (if
a proxy server messes up your IP address when using port 80, using port 8888
will get around the proxy), "Username" and "Password" should be left blank,
"Get" should be set to /, and you might like to put 0.0.0.0 in "Exclude".

Tick the "Account" section, "Signin ID" and "Password" should be set to what
you use to sign in to DNS Park, put a tick in "Mail" and set "Priority" to 0
if you host your own mail.

Tick the "Host" section and put your host name in "Name" (You will need one
host for every host record (A) you have setup on DNS Park. You do not need any
host records for alias records (CNAME)). You can add as many hosts as you want.
To add more than one, click "Commit" when you've entered your first host and
the configuration screen will pop back with an extra blank host. Fill out that
blank host to add, take the tick out of any host that you want to remove and
click "Commit" again.
